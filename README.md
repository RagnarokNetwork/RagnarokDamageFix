# RagnarokDamageFix
A simple plugin that allows you to change the damage modifier, that each level of sharpness adds to the total output damage. This plugin does not necessarily fix anything, but on our server the damage output of sharpened swords was unbalanced, so that's why we called it a "fix" at the time.
